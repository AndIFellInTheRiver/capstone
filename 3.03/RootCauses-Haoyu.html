          Greenhouse gas emissions has been one of the greatest problem for causing climate change and global warming, either industrial use or residential use, it is important that we consider a second source of energy for our energy use. Most likely renewable.</ul>

        <h1>Root Cause #2</h1>
        <ul class ="list-unstyled text-muted causes-state" >
          The acres of land covered in forests has been greatly reduced since the humans learn to use tools. According to a study,  18 millions acres of forest is lost every year due to various reason, mostly not naturally occurring. But having less tree means there are less carbon being recycled, leaveing it in the atmosphere.</ul>

        <h6>Evidence #1 <ui class="text-muted">Slash and burn an agricultural system where farms and their 
          existing vegetation are cut down and burned off, and subsequently, the land is used for the 
          cultivation of agricultural crops. Although in some instances it can be advantageous, burning 
          biomass on such a large scale comes with many consequences. It is estimated that the total 
          amount of biomass burned by humans make up a whopping 90% of the total number, where natural 
          fires are only around 10%. According to NASA.</ui></h6>

      <div class="col evidence-mid">
        <h6>Explanation <ui class="text-muted">Since fires produce carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, biomass burning emissions
          significantly influence the Earth's atmosphere and climate. Biomass burning has both short- and
          long-term impacts on the environment. Vegetation acts as a sink—a natural storage area—for
          carbon dioxide by storing it over time through the process of photosynthesis. As burning occurs, it
          can release hundreds of years worth of stored carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in a matter of
          hours. Burning also will permanently destroy an important sink for carbon dioxide if the vegetation
          is not replaced</ui></h6>

      <div class="col ">
        <h6>Evidence #1 <ui class="text-muted">Cattle ranching has a massive impact on forests around the world, particularly tropical rainforests
          like the Amazon. Many farmers use deforested areas of land to raise cattle; however, it might
          surprise you to learn that corporations do this on a much larger scale. Fast food companies have
          been contributing to deforestation in places like the Amazon rainforest for quite some time, and
          only in relatively recent years have their actions been acknowledged by mainstream media. </ui></h6>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <h6>Explanation <ui class="text-muted">It is estimated that 25% of the world’s total greenhouse gas production comes from deforestation
          alone. Furthermore, forests around the world store more than double the amount of carbon
          cioxide than is found in the atmosphere This means that when areas are deforested, the carbon
          dioxide stored in those trees is released into the atmosphere. </ui> </h6>

        <h6>Evidence #2 <ui class="text-muted">The world’s growing energy need, alongside increasing population 
          led to the continual use of fossil fuel-based energy sources (Coal, Oil and Gas) 
          which became problematic by creating several challenges such as: depletion of fossil fuel reserves, 
          greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental concerns, geopolitical and military conflicts, 
          and the continual fuel price fluctuations. These problems will create unsustainable situations 
          which will eventually result in potentially irreversible threat to human societies.</ui></h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col evidence-mid">
        <h6>Explanation <ui class="text-muted">The burning of fossil fuel to produce energy sufficient for 
          everyone has been a big factor contributing to the cause of greenhouse gas emission. the more we 
          continue to produce energy in such waay, the more irreversible harm we will do to the environment.
          though research has already shown sustainable energy on reneweable source has been reliable, people's 
          perception about nuclear power are still unclear due to its dangerous nature.  </ui></h6>

      <div class="col ">
        <h6>Evidence #2 <ui class="text-muted">Infrastructures and Housing, also called “urban sprawl” is 
           the final major contributing cause of deforestation. Urban sprawl is one of the most 
           difficult deforestation-related issues to solve. This is due to the fact that, 
           at its base, urban sprawl is driven by overpopulation. In fact, overpopulation is one the 
           most complex and pressing issues at the base of many environmental problems</ui></h6>
      </div>
      <div class="col ">
        <h6>Explanation <ui class="text-muted">The beef industry for fast food and generally, 
          American style foods has been a problem for decades. Fast food companies or just the 
          general public are always adressing the issue but never addressing any solutions to it. 
          Housing and infrastructure is also a major contributing factor to deforestation. 
          Though at base, this is simply a problem that is caused by overpopulation and we can't 
          just simply eliminate the population by half or so. If we could solve the problem of 
          overpopulation then it should be much easier to tackle deforestation.</ui></h6>

          <h4>Implication</h4>
          <br>
          <p class="text-muted"> Greenhouse gas emmissions are generally caused by the releasing of CO2,
            most of the time from the burning of fossil fuel and others. And the reason why fossil fuel is 
            getting burned so much is because we need to produce energy sufficient for the entire society. 
            So we could think of a different way to produce electricity to counter the use of fossiel fuels.
            There are many natural resources that we could and we have been utilizing but not enough to 
            produce energy. Such as oceanic, hydropower, solar power, wind, geothermal, nuclear, and bioenergy. 
            tough we already have all these possible source that can produce energy, people are still quesioning
            the nuclear way of generating power due to its dangerous nature. We need to change people's view about
            nuclear power because it is clean and sustainable energy that can last people for decades. It is only
            due to poor personnel and handling that Japan had a nuclear leak, as long as we be strict and precise 
            with it, we can make the energy transition much faster than we anticipated.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">Deforestation is another huge contributing factor to global warming and 
            climate change. Though deforestation is the hardest issue to solve because of the simple
             reason of overpopulation. So instead of cutting the population or so, we could borrow an 
             idea from China, limit the birth of childrens. If this idea is implemented, it could 
             possibly limit the population growth by decades or centuries. At the mean time, we could
              work on growing back trees, we possibly couldn't work on the land that has already been 
              used for cattle ranching, but we could think of a way to use trees and plants to 
              undesertify, utilizing drylands for grounds of possible new forests in the future.</p>
