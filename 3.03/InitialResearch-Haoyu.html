<!-- STEP TWO: CUSTOMIZE THE LOOK-->
<!-- Make adjustments to the display size, text color, background color, border, text alignment, etc... -->
<!-- Use 4 different types of bootstrap classes -->
<!-- The best way to do this is to search using the navbar. Put in a term OR a class tag -->
<!-- A few pages that should be helpful to start out with.... 
  Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/content/typography/ to adjust the display (size, etc)
  Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/customize/color/ to adjust color attributes 
  (there's also different pages with background color, opacity, etc )-->

          There are lots of methods we could utilize to help eliminate this problem, such as reducing natural gas uses and fossil fuel, more natural ways to generate energy, and as long as people eat less meat, the meat industry will produce less gas, but these are just some of the short term solutions, for the long term we want to completely switch out energy source away from fossil fuels and have better forest control to prevent more forest fire and grow more trees.        </ul>
