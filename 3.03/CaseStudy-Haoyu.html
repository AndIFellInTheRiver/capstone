        <p>Though Carbon Direct is one way of solving the one of the major causes of climate change, which is emmissions caused by 
          big companies. But in the end, it is way harder to change the source of energy since these huge corporates won't dedicate 
          their efforts into it. In reality, the true problems are these big corporates is that they won't cooperate with the emmission goal,
          on top of that, we also have the whole meat industry contributing to all of these, also causing deforestation. The agriculture
          itself is also causing emmission and deforestation , there are no good way to stop this since infrastructuresare built to meet 
          the population's needs. After all of these research, the true root cause of these root causes are simply "overpoplation", though 
          we can't simply eliminate the numbers, or destroy whats already built to revive nature. A solutions is to work on undesertification,
          by introducing invasive species that survives well in the desert to revitalize the soil, that way, we could turn something useless
          into something useful, we could grow trees on these new found soil or grow trees anywhere possible in order to purify pollution, 
          meanwhile, let's work on going green.
